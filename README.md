# docker swarm app
TODO: Build and run manually
- Needs local version of redis + mongo
- Run all services, visit port 4000

Build all images and push to dockerhub
- Update build instructions to push to your own dockerhub (probably super slow)
- quick command `npm run deploy`
- update docker compose to pull from your images
- Run on ec2
